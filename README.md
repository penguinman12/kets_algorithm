I believe there is no difference in using this code.
This is the K-ETS algorithm, which is used in K-ETS to calculate trade data like the trader's trade quantity or price.


Additionally, the code at this GitHub repository, https://github.com/penguinman12/kets-market is for creating the ETS simulation.
I would appreciate it if you could review both of my codes. I'll continue to develop my simulation codes year after year. 

Thank you!
